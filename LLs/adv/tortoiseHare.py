## Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm

## Fast and Slow pointers

# Uses:
#   To find mid point of LL, fast will reach the end. Slow will be mid-1
#   To test for cyclic LL, fast and slow will meet. (Eventually the fast pointer catches up with the slow pointer)


## LL

# 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
# s    f 

# slow pointer at first node, fast pointer at second node, now move the fast pointer twice and slow pointer once.
