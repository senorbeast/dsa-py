#### TC, SC

- Omega:  "Ω(n)" denotes best-case time complexity, a lower bound on operations in optimal scenarios.
- Theta: "Θ(n)" signifies average-case time complexity, where operations grow linearly on average for all inputs.
- Oh: O(n)" represents worst-case time complexity, indicating an upper bound on operations as input size grows.

##### SC

- "How much additional memory is needed by the algorithm to process the input data?"

- Types:
  - Auxiliary Space Complexity: Extra memory used by the algorithm for variables, data structures, and execution overhead, beyond the input.
  - Input Space Complexity: Memory needed to hold input data, typically treated as constant since it's inherent to the problem statement. (unaffected by the algorithm's structure or design)
