#### TC, SC

- Omega:  "Ω(n)" denotes best-case time complexity, a lower bound on operations in optimal scenarios.
- Theta: "Θ(n)" signifies average-case time complexity, where operations grow linearly on average for all inputs.
- Oh: O(n)" represents worst-case time complexity, indicating an upper bound on operations as input size grows.

##### SC

- All space required for the program to run.
  - So, even if you are just returning an array (of size input array), SC minimum would be O(n).
