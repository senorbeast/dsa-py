# Backtracking

# Kind of a brute force approach, in which we backtracking from our mistake and try out another way.

# Question:
#
# Determine if a path exist from the root of the tree to a leaf node, without any 0s in the path.
# Return true if true.


#     4
#  0     1
#   7   2 0


# Here, only valid path is 4 -> 1 -> 2
